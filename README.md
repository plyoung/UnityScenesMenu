# Unity Scenes Menu

A scenes dropdown on the unity toolbar.

Put `Scripts\Editor\EditorSceneMenu\` in your project's Assets folder and you should see the "Scenes" dropdown on the unity toolbar.

A `EditorScenesMenuAsset.asset` data file is created in the same folder that this plugin's scripts are located.

There is a "Settings" option in the scenes dropdown. This opens a window where you can add and remove scenes that should appear in the dropdown menu.
